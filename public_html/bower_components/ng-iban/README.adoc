= ng-iban - validate input fields as IBAN
The goal is to provide an easy way to validate an input field as an IBAN number with https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS].
From version `0.4.0` the module uses https://github.com/arhs/iban.js[iban.js] for validation.

== Installation

=== Bower

`bower install ng-iban`

=== NPM

`npm install ng-iban`

=== Other

Download file `dist/ng-iban.min.js`.

== Usage

Add `mm.iban` as a dependency of your AngularJS module.

=== directive
[source,html]
----
<input type="text" ng-model="iban" ng-iban/>
----

To use this directive the `ngModel` directive must also be used because this directive depends on it.

=== filter
[source,html]
----
IBAN: {{ string | iban:separator }}
----

The filter converts a given IBAN to it's human-friendly represantation. The separator defaults to a single space.
